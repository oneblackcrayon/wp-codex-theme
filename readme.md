This theme has no HTML tags. It generates only what WordPress naturally has built in. In other words, there are no div, h1, p, ul/ol tags inside the template files.  
What is rendered in the HTML (check out View Source in your browser) is produced by WordPress.

We (because it is open-sourced and can be forked on Github and built upon by the community) have done our best to be a well documented as possible without overloading your ability to read, investigate, troubleshoot issues/bugs or expand/adapt/modify the theme on your own accord. 

## Where did the code come from?

Most, if not all, of the code for this theme came from the [WordPress Codex](http://codex.wordpress.org) and from the WordPress [TwentyTwelve](http://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwelve) and [TwentyThirteen](http://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen) themes.

This theme's functions.php file only has the opening PHP tag and commented-out information about file.

Each theme file has a PHP tag that has commented-out information about what the file does and where to first look about information on the file and its use.
